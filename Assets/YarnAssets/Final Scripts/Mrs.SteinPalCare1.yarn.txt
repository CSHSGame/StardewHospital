[$Char2Last]: Oh, right! Hi.
[$PlayerName]: Nice to see you!
[$Char2Last]:  Yes, it is. I’m just preparing for my Tea ‘n Talk later.  I always get called on to lead the program because I can get everyone talking!
[$PlayerName]:  That’s great,  [$Char2First]! I've heard how the residents look forward to the program.
[$Char2Last]: Of course, dear. Can you come and pick me up afterwards? 
[$PlayerName]: Sure, see you later!

[$Char2Last]: *cough cough* Thank you for sharing with us ($PlayerName).
[$PlayerName]: Can I get you some water?
[$Char2Last]: Yes, please. And can you get my puffer? It’s the blue colored one on the table.
[$PlayerName]: Here you go.
[$Char2Last]: Thanks! *cough cough*
[$PlayerName]: I can see why the residents enjoy this program, [$Char2First]. You have a great way of making people feel comfortable.
[$Char2Last]: I’ve learned as I get older that all that matters in life is love and relationships.
[$PlayerName]: That’s a lovely thought. I’m learning a lot from you, [$Char2First]. I’ll see you tomorrow bright and early.
[$Char2Last]: Good. Thanks for helping out. See you tomorrow.
[$PlayerName]: Bye.

[$Char2Last]: You’re right, dear. I was sent to the hospital after I had trouble breathing. Everyone was quite worried about me.  
[$PlayerName]: Of course, they were. Everyone cares so much about you, [$Char2First]. You’re so friendly to everyone.
[$Char2Last]: You’re very kind, dear. 
[$PlayerName]: But is everything is alright?  Will you be coming to Tea ‘n’ Talk this afternoon? 
[$Char2Last]:  Oh, not today, dear. Have you met [$Char2RoommateFirst], my roommate?
[$PlayerName]: Hi there, [$Char2RoommateFirst].
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: Hi, how are you doing?
[$PlayerName]: I’m doing well, how about you?
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: I’m fine, dear.
[$Char2Last]: Come sit next to me [$Char2RoommateFirst]!
[$PlayerName]: I’d better go.
[$Char2Last]: Can you stay just a bit longer, [$PlayerName]? I want to talk to you about something.
[$PlayerName]: Sure, I can stay.
[$Char2Last]: You and I haven’t really gotten to know each other very well, but I already know I like you, and I appreciate you. I think you’re going to be very successful in your career.
[$PlayerName]: Thank you...
[$Char2Last]:  I just want you to know... Well, there’s no easy way to say this, but this last crisis was very serious, and I’ve learned that I now have very little time left.

[[Don’t say that, [$Char2First]! You’ll be okay. You need to think positively!|PalCareDay5Eve]]
[[I don’t understand. What do you mean?|PalCareDay5Eve]]

[$Char2RoommateFirst]: [$Char2First]... 
[$Char2Last]: You’ve learned a little about me by now, and you know that I like to speak frankly. I know that I’m dying, and it’s okay. My health has been a struggle for quite a while now. I’m at peace with this.

[[But how can you be. You must have been shocked when they told you!|PalCareDay5Okay]]
[[But maybe there’s been a mistake.  Can’t they try some different treatment?|PalCareDay5Okay]]

[$Char2Last]: It’s okay, dear. There are no magic words anyone can say. It’s enough to know that you care. I’ve had a wonderful life and I’m happy I’ve had the chance to get to know you.
[$PlayerName]: It’s been wonderful knowing you, too. I just didn’t expect... 
[$Char2Last]: Of course not, and that’s alright. Now you  run along now, dear.  My daughter is coming soon. 
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: I love seeing Hana. Will she bring the children?
[$Char2Last]: Yes, I can’t wait! Now, you two, stop it with the long faces.I’ll see you tomorrow, [$PlayerName].
[$PlayerName]: If you need anything Eve, please let me know. Have a good visit with [$Char2DaughterFirst]!

[$PlayerName]: Hi, [$SupervisorName]. I was just with [$Char2First] and she told me that she is dying. I didn’t know what to say. I want to help her but I don’t know what to do.
[$SupervisorName]:  I know the news was unexpected, and this is hard for all of us.  We need to support Eve in what she needs - and continue to be professional.  
[$PlayerName]:   I’ll do my best but . . .
[$SupervisorName]: It’s always difficult when this happens. That’s why we have support services in place for our staff and students – and also for residents’ families.  You can talk to a support person about what you’re feeling, and it will be confidential.
[$PlayerName]: I didn’t realize this service was available.  
[$SupervisorName]: Remember, we’re all here to help and support our residents - and each other. Tomorrow there’s a care conference with Eve to discuss about  any changes she’d like to make in her care – and to talk about her final wishes. Here’s a resource I’d like you to read about the end-of-life in long-term care.. It will help you to be prepared for tomorrow’s care conference. 
[$PlayerName]: This is my first experience with someone I know who is dying.  
[$SupervisorName]: You’ll be okay.  Take care and I’ll see you tomorrow then.
[$PlayerName]: Yes, see you tomorrow.

[$SupervisorName]:  Hello there, Eve.  Are you still feeling up to meeting with our team?
[$Char2Last]: Well, I’m feeling a little cooped up in here. It would be nice to have a change. Could we meet in  the Chapel? Could Hana and Katherine come as well?  
[$SupervisorName]: Of course. 
[$PlayerName]: I’ll get the wheelchair.

[$SocialWorkerName]: [$Char2First], we’re all here to talk about any changes you’d like to your care plan and any wishes you have in order to make you more comfortable. Anything you need at all. 
[$Char2Last]: Well, I have been thinking about a few things.  I wonder if you could turn my bed to face the window, so I can feel the sun?  
[$SupervisorName]: We can, of course, rearrange your room if that’s okay with you, [$Char2RoommateFirst]? 
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: Of course! Anything for my friend. 
[$Char2Last]: You know how I love the ocean. I know I can’t get there anymore but it would remind me of happy times there to have a really large picture of the ocean on my wall... 
[$Char2DaughterFirst]: Mom, I’ll enlarge one of your great photos of the ocean. 
[$Char2Last]: That would be wonderful. And could you bring all my family photo albums to look through?
I’m too tired to do much talking now but I’d love to listen to more music in my room.  
[$PlayerName]: I know you love Frank Sinatra, [$Char2First]. Are there any other types of music you’d like?
[$Char2Last]: Hmm... It would be nice to have some of my favourite hymns playing quietly. 
[$ActivationName]: I can create a playlist for you, [$Char2First], and bring a CD player up to your room. You can tell me all your favourite hymns and Sinatra songs.
[$Char2Last]: Haha, You would probably need more than a list, more likely a  book of songs. Of course, I’d rather have Frank Sinatra in person. He was quite a guy. 
[$PlayerName]: You always make me laugh, [$Char2First].
[$Char2Last]: That’s a great compliment. Thank you!.
[$PlayerName]: Is there anything else we can do, [$Char2First]?
[$Char2Last]: Well, if anyone were to bring in some flowers, I love Gerbera Daisies. 
[$PlayerName]: I’ll get them!
[$Char2DaughterFirst]: Do you think it would be possible for me to stay overnight with my mom?
[$SupervisorName]: Of course, you can. We can put an extra cot in the room. You can be here as much as you like.  
[$Char2DaughterFirst]: Thank you.
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: [$Char2First], what about one more Tea ‘n Talk? Maybe just the three of us? 
[$Char2Last]: Oh, yes, [$Char2RoommateFirst], let's do that. Will you help, [$PlayerName]? 
[$PlayerName]: I’ll help you have a lovely Tea ‘n Talk for you in your room. What else would you like?
[$Char2Last]: I want you all to know that I’m sad to say good-bye. but I have had a wonderful life. 
And I don’t want a funeral when I’m gone. I want there to be a celebration of life.
[$ActivationName]: Of course, I would love to help you with the planning. 
[$Char2Last]: Thank you, everyone. [$Char2DaughterFirst], I’m quite tired. Let’s you and I go back to my room now.

[$SupervisorName]: Please, [$Char2DaughterFirst], [$Char2RoommateFirst], come on in and sit down. It’s been a tough few days. We all miss [$Char2First] very much.  
[$Char2DaughterFirst]: I’m grateful to everyone, especially to the staff who arranged everything for mom.  I`m so grateful I was able to spend these last precious days with her. I tried to give the night nurse a card with some money, but she said she couldn’t accept it, so I want to make a donation to  [$HospitalName] on my mom’s behalf. Mom was so happy here and your wonderful care and support made all the difference. 
[$SupervisorName]: Thank you.  Are you taking care of yourself?
[$Char2DaughterFirst]: My mom told me the greatest lesson she ever learned was how in the end all that matters are love and relationships. I’m trying to take it one day at a time and focus my energy on my kids. 
[$PlayerName]: I remember [$Char2First] telling me the same thing after our first Tea ‘N Talk session!
[$SupervisorName]: [$Char2First] was very wise.  How are you doing, [$Char2RoommateFirst]?
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: It’s so hard to lose her. And now I’ll have a new roommate already - tomorrow! But no one can take her place.

[$SupervisorName]: [$Char2RoommateFirst], it’s okay to feel sad, it’s okay to cry. You don’t have to try to be ‘strong.’ [$Char2First] was your dear friend. 
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: Yes, she was. Thank you. 
[$SupervisorName]: [$Char2RoommateFirst], This is a great loss to you. I think it might help for you to talk some more about your friendship with Eve?
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: It’s so difficult when someone you care about dies.  
[$PlayerName]: I can't sleep.  I keep replaying our last conversation in my head…. 
[$SupervisorName]: [$Char2RoommateFirst], I’d really like to hear more about how you’re feeling?
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: She was my  special friend… I spent almost  every waking moment with her since I moved here – now I'll wake up or enter a room thinking she's still here, then realize all over again that she's gone – and it feels like losing her all over again... Why did she get cancer? It’s not fair!
[$Char2DaughterFirst]: You had a close relationship with my mom this past year, Katherine. Thank you for being her best friend. She loved you very much.
[$SupervisorName]: [$Char2RoommateFirst], is there anyone here you can rely on for support?
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: I went to all the Tea ‘n Talk meetings with [$Char2First] and some of the other activities where I made friends with a few other residents  - but I don’t feel interested in doing anything now...  
[$SupervisorName]: That's normal, [$Char2RoommateFirst]. You need time to grieve. And it will feel lonely to go to activities you used to enjoy without [$Char2First] by your side – but remember, you’re not alone here. I urge you to keep attending your favorite activities and spending time with your other friends here.  
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: I'll try… It’s just too painful. I end up crying.
[$SupervisorName]: It sounds like it would be a good idea for you to talk to a counsellor here -  this kind of support can be very helpful. 
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: Okay.  I’ll think about it…
[$Char2DaughterFirst]: I think I might need that kind of support, too.
[$SupervisorName]: I can arrange that for you, too, [$Char2DaughterFirst]. 
[$Char2DaughterFirst]:  Thank you. 
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: [$Char2DaughterFirst], I’ll see you tomorrow for the celebration of [$Char2First]’s life.   
[$SupervisorName]: Yes, I’ll see you both tomorrow at 2 o’clock.  
[$Char2RoommateFirst]: It's just what Eve wanted. . .
