//****PROGRAMMERS NOTE**** The player arrives at Maries, the door is closed.
[Door]: Knock Knock
[$playerName]: Marie? Are you there? It’s me, [$playerName].
[$Char4First]: Come in.
[$playerName]: Ok, I’m coming in… 
[$playerName]: just opening the door… 
[$playerName]: and coming in to the room now...
[$Char4First]: You can come right in.
<<SetPath Controller Zero>> //The player enters the room
[$playerName]: Ok! Here I am.
[$Char4First]: Hmm, yes, here you are.
[$playerName]: So! [$Char4First], I just wanted to apologize for the other day, barging in here. I know this is your home and I want to respect your privacy and I should have gotten your consent before entering. 
[$Char4First]: My dear, mistakes happen. I wasn’t upset with you for walking in on my companion and I. If anything it’s been your behaviour since then that I find a bit bothersome. 
[[[$playerName]: What do you mean? What's wrong with my behaviour?!!|Sexuality_Defense]]<<$Sexuality_Defensive = true>>
[[[$playerName]: Oh! I’m so sorry.  But what do you mean, specifically, [$Char4First]? Did I say something wrong?|Sexuality_Defense]]<<$Sexuality_Defensive = false>>

[$Char4First]: It’s not anything you’ve said really, but you’ve been treating me like I was from another planet! I can see how uncomfortable you are with me. Do you have a problem with my relationship with Fred?
[$playerName]: No! Of course not. I think it’s great that you and Fred are, you know, an “item.”
[$Char4First]: We’re not an item!  Don’t go telling people that!
[$playerName]: I’m sorry! I mean, it’s great that you guys are, well, whatever you are... I’m sorry! I’m trying not to be weird! 
[$Char4First]: Well, you’ll have to try harder! Fred and I have a casual, sexual relationship, which we both enjoy.  I think we’re mature enough to handle that. Are you?
[$playerName]: It’s just that I haven’t known that many older people until I came here.  Just my grandparents.  It’s kind of an adjustment.
[$Char4First]: Do you think your grandparents have sex?
[[[$playerName]: Definitely not.|Sexuality_Know]]
[[[$playerName]: I don’t’ know.|Sexuality_Know]]
[[[$playerName]: No way!|Sexuality_Know]]

[$Char4First]: How would you know?
[$playerName]:  I mean . . . I don’t know, I guess. I kind of assumed they were too old and didn’t do that anymore.  
[$Char4First]: Because you think that’s true?  Or because you don’t want to think about it?
[$playerName]: ...I don’t know. 
[$Char4First]: [$playerName] I know that you want to do this job because you are a caring person.  I can see that in you. 
[$playerName]: Thanks, [$Char4First].  You’re very kind.
[$Char4First]: But you need to remember that we’re people just like you.  No matter our age. We have our own private lives, and our own feelings – and you’d probably be surprised how similar they are to many of yours. Do you mind if I ask if you have anyone special in your life?
[$playerName]: Yeah. I do. I have a partner.  
[$Char4First]: And do you have an intimate relationship?  
[$playerName]: [$Char4First]! That’s personal.
[$Char4First]: You see what I’m getting at?
[$playerName]: Okay. I see I have a lot to learn.  Thanks for talking about this with me.  I really appreciate it.
[$Char4First]: Any big plans tonight?
[$playerName]: We might go do a movie or just hang out.
[$Char4First]: Well, don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!   
[$playerName]: Very funny...
