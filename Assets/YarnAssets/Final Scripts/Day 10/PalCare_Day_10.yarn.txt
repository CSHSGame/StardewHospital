[$NurseManager]:  I just wanted to let you know that last night Eve passed away peacefully in her sleep. Her daughter and Katherine were by her side.
[$playerName]: Oh...
[$NurseManager]: Are you okay?
[$playerName]: I wasn’t expecting that... so soon...
[$NurseManager]: If you would like to stay here for a couple minutes to collect your thoughts, that’s fine.
