[$NurseManager]: Good Morning [$playerName]...
[$playerName]: Hey [$NurseManager]. Is something wrong?
[$NurseManager]: Actually yes... [$Char1Last] was taken to the hospital last night. She was having difficulty breathing.  
[$playerName]: Oh no... I knew she wasn't feeling well yesterday but I didn't think...
[$playerName]: I don't know what I thought.
[$NurseManager]: Anyways, sorry to tell you this first thing, but I thought you'd want to know.
[$playerName]: Of course.
[$NurseManager]: When you have a moment, please check in on [$Char3First]. He seems like he's having a rough time.
[$playerName]: I noticed that as well. I'll pay him a visit.
