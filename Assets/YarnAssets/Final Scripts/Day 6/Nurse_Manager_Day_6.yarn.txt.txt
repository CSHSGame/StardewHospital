[$SupervisorName]: Morning [$PlayerName]. 
[$PlayerName]: Hey [$SupervisorsName], anything new? 
[$SupervisorName]: Mrs. Stein returned last night.  
[$PlayerName]: That's great news! 
[$SupervisorName]: She’s such a wonderful lady... all the residents were happy to welcome her back, especially her roommate Katherine. 
[$PlayerName]: How nice – I don’t think I’ve met Katherine yet. 
[$SupervisorName]: Mrs. Stein and Katherine are in their room now. Pay them a visit and see how they’re doing.  
[$PlayerName]: Okay, I’m on my way.
