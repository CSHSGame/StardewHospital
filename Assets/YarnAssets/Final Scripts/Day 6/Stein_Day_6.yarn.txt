[$Char1FirstDoor]:Knock Knock.
[$playerName]: Hi, [$Char1First]. It’s [$playerName]. Can I come in?
[$Char1Last]: Yes, come in, dear.
<<Hide SteinDoor>>
<<SetPath Player Zero>>
[sad][$playerName]: How are you? I heard that you went to the hospital...
[sad][$Char1Last]: You’re right, dear. I was taken to the hospital after I had trouble breathing. Everyone was quite worried about me.
[$playerName]: Of course they were. Everyone cares so much about you, [$Char1First]. You’re so friendly to everyone.
[$Char1Last]: You're very kind, dear.
[$playerName]: But is everything all right? Will you be coming to Tea ‘n Talk this afternoon?
[$Char1Last]: Oh, not today, dear. Have you met [$Katherine], my roommate? 
//(She points to [$Katherine] who is also in the room, sitting in a chair reading on the other side of the room.)
[$playerName]: Hi there, [$Katherine] 
//(Player waves to [$Katherine])
[$Katherine]: Hi. How are you doing?
[$playerName]: I’m doing well. How about you?
[$Katherine]: I’m fine, dear.
[$Char1Last]: Come sit next to me, [$Katherine]! 
//(Motions with hand) ([$Katherine] sits next to Eve) 
<<SetPath Katherine Zero>>
[$playerName]: I’d better go. I’ll see you later.
[sad][$Char1Last]: Can you just stay a bit longer [$playerName]? I want to talk to you about something …
[$playerName]: Sure, I can stay.
[$Char1Last]: You and I haven’t really gotten to know each other very well, but I already know I like you, and I appreciate you. 
[$Char1Last]: I think you’re going to be very successful in your career.
[$playerName]: Thank you...
[sad][$Char1Last]: I just want you to know... well, there’s no easy way to say this… but this last crisis was very serious... 
[sad][$Char1Last]: I’ve learned that I now have very little time left.

[$Char1Last]: You’ve learned a little about me by now, and you know that I like to speak frankly.
[sad][$Char1Last]: I know that I’m dying, and it’s okay. My health has been a struggle for quite a while now. I’m at peace with this.
[[I’m so sorry...|Stein_Day_6_Part_3]]<<Stein_Day_6_Part_2_Right== true>>
[[But how can you be? You must have been shocked when they told you!|Stein_Day_6_Part_3]]<<Stein_Day_6_Part_2_Right== false>>

[sad][$playerName]: I’m not sure what the right thing is to say...
[sad][$Char1Last]: It’s okay, dear. There are no magic words anyone can say. It’s enough to know that you care. 
[$Char1Last]: You need to know that I’ve had a wonderful life. I’m just happy I’ve had the chance to get to know you.
[sad][$playerName]: It’s been wonderful knowing you, too. I just didn’t expect …
[$Char1Last]: Of course not, and that’s all right. Give me a hug. Now you run along now, dear, my daughter is coming to visit soon.
[$Katherine]: I love seeing [$Hana]. Will she bring the children?
//(wipes off her tears) 
[$Char1Last]: Yes, I can’t wait! Now, you two, stop with the long faces.
[$playerName] I’ll see you tomorrow.
<<Spawn Hana>>
[$playerName]: If you need anything, Eve, please let me know. Have a good visit with [$Hana].
<<SetPath Hana Zero>>
// Hana entres the room as player leaves.
[$playerName]: Oh you must be [$Hana]
[$Hana]: Yes I am. I’m here to see my mom.
[$playerName]: She’s waiting for you. My name is [$playerName], I’m a placement student here.
[$Hana]: Nice to meet you.
[$playerName]: Have a good visit.
<<SetPath Player One>>
//Player walks to nurse at front desk
[sad][$playerName]: [$NurseManager], I was just with [$Char1First], she told me that she is dying.
[sad][$playerName]: I didn’t know what to say. I want to help her but I don’t know what to do.
[sad][$NurseManager]: I know the news was unexpected, and this is hard for all of us. 
[sad][$NurseManager]: We need to support [$Char1First] in what she needs - and continue to be professional.
[sad][$playerName]: I’ll do my best but . . .
[sad][$NurseManager]: It’s always difficult when this happens - and when a resident dies. 
[$NurseManager]: That’s why we have support services in place for our staff and students – and also for residents’ families. 
[$NurseManager]: You can talk to a support person about what you’re feeling, and it will be confidential.
[$playerName]: I didn’t realize this service was available.
[$NurseManager]: Remember, we’re all here to help and support our residents - and each other. 
[$NurseManager]: We're arranging a care conference with [$Char1First] to discuss any changes she’d like to make in her care – and to talk about her final wishes.
[$NurseManager]: I'm going to send you some material I’d like you to read about end-of-life and palliative care in long-term care.. 
[$NurseManager]: It will help you prepare for the care conference.
[sad][$playerName]: This is my first experience with someone I know who is dying.
[$NurseManager]: You’ll be okay. Take care and I’ll see you tomorrow then.
[$playerName]: Yes, see you tomorrow.
