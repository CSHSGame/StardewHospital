[$SupervisorName]: Hello there (player’s name), My name is (Supervisor’s name) and welcome to Bloom Village! Today we will be touring the village and I will introduce you to some of our residents.  
[$PlayerName]: Great! I am excited to be here and meet the residents. 
[$SupervisorName]: Alright then! First, this is our nursing station. This is where you can locate our resident’s care plan, medication administration records and other files/documents needed for our residents. 
[$SupervisorName]: At every shift change our nurse and personal support workers have a huddle to talk about the care plan and prioritize the resident’s needs. So, if you have any questions you can always approach the staff here. 
[$PlayerName]: Great! 
[$SupervisorName]: Okay, let’s go to our dining room. 
//Goes to the dining room together with the player. 
[$SupervisorName]: This is the main dining room.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served here  . At the back of the dining room you will find the servery which holds our meals. When you are here, you can assist the staff in feeding residents who require assistance.  
[$PlayerName]: I would love to do that! I have one question. 
[$SupervisorName]: Yes! 
[$PlayerName]: Can the resident choose their own seat? 
[$SupervisorName]: No, we have a seating plan for our residents which is organized based on resident’s needs, preferences and other circumstances.  
[$PlayerName]: Great. 
[$SupervisorName]: Alright, let’s go the multifaith room. Again, feel free to ask questions and I’ll try my best to answer. 
[$PlayerName]: Yes. 
//Going to the multifaith room. 
[$SupervisorName]: Here we are. This is the Bloom Village’s multifaith room for every resident and their family to utilize. It is a great space to pray, for quiet time or meditation. 
[$SupervisorName]: You are free to bring a resident here for a one-on-one conversation. Goes to the multifaith room, knocks on the door, peaks and finds Marie Moore.  
[$SupervisorName]: Oh Marie is here trying to mediate. Let’s leave quietly.  Closes the door.  
[$PlayerName]: Great! Can staff access that as well? 
[$SupervisorName]: Yes! Absolutely! Everyone is welcome here. 
[$PlayerName]: That is perfect! 
[$SupervisorName]: Alright, shall we go? We can visit to the activity room.  
//Goes to the activity room 
[$SupervisorName]: We are here! Oh, I think Eve is setting up for the Tea N Talk program.  
[$PlayerName]: What’s that? 
[$SupervisorName]: Why don’t we ask Eve herself. Goes to see Eve. Hi there Eve! 
[$Char2Last]: Hi [$SupervisorName]. Who do we have here? 
[$PlayerName]: Hi Eve, I’m [$PlayerName]. I was just going to ask what activity are you planning. 
[$Char2Last]: It’s called Tea N Talk. I invite all residents an d we discuss “hot” topics, in the news or in life.  
[$PlayerName]: That’s really great. Can I join you one day? 
[$Char2Last]: Absolutely dear! Anyone is welcome here. 
[$PlayerName]: That is great! 
[$SupervisorName]: Thank you Eve! [$PlayerName], shall we go? Let's go to visit one of the resident’s room. 
[$PlayerName]: Okay 
//Goes to one empty private room.  
[$SupervisorName]: This is what a private room looks like. Each room has a bed with a call bell, side table, chair, cabinet and a bathroom. 
[$SupervisorName]: Each resident is encouraged to customize their own room to make them feel comfortable and welcomed in their private space.  
[$PlayerName]: Great! It's really important that the residents can make their room welcoming and comfortable.  
[$SupervisorName]: Let's visit Mr. Wojick’s room.

[$SupervisorName]: Knocks on the door and performs hand hygiene and peaks on the door. Hi Syd! It’s (Supervisor’s name). Can I introduce you to a new student? 
[$Char3Last]: No thank you, I'd rather to talk to anyone right now. Sorry… Can you please leave?  
[$SupervisorName]: Alright [$Char3Last]. We understand, maybe another time.  
[$Char3Last]: Yeah.. Sure 
//Leaves the room 
[$SupervisorName]:  It is important to respect our resident’s choices. How about we go visit our garden? 
[$PlayerName]: Sounds good.
