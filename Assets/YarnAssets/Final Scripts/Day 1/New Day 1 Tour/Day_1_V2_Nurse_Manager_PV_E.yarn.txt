[$NurseManager]: Hello there [$playerName], My name is [$NurseManager] and welcome to Bloom Village! Today we will be touring the village and I will introduce you to some of our residents.  
[$playerName]: Great! I am excited to be here and meet the residents. 
[$NurseManager]: Alright then! First, this is our nursing station. This is where you can locate our resident’s care plan, medication administration records and other files/documents needed for our residents. 
[$NurseManager]: At every shift change our nurse and personal support workers have a huddle to talk about the care plan and prioritize the resident’s needs. So, if you have any questions you can always approach the staff here. 
[$playerName]: Great! 
[$NurseManager]: Okay, let’s go to our dining room. 
//Goes to the dining room together with the player. 
<<SetPath Player One>><<SetPath Nurse One>>
[$NurseManager]: This is the main dining room.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served here. At the back of the dining room you will find the servery which holds our meals. When you are here, you can assist the staff in feeding residents who require assistance.  
[$playerName]: I would love to do that! I have one question. 
[$NurseManager]: Yes! 
[$playerName]: Can the resident choose their own seat? 
[$NurseManager]: No, we have a seating plan for our residents which is organized based on resident’s needs, preferences and other circumstances. Don't hesitate to ask a resident where they sit or a staff member for the seating plan.
[$playerName]: Great. 
[$NurseManager]: All right, let’s go to the multifaith room. Again, feel free to ask questions and I’ll try my best to answer. 
[$playerName]: Yes. 
//Going to the multifaith room.
<<SetPath Player Two>><<SetPath Nurse Two>>
[$NurseManager]: Here we are. This is the Bloom Village’s multifaith room for every resident and their family to utilize. It is a great space to pray, for quiet time or meditation. 
[$NurseManager]: You are free to bring a resident here for a one-on-one conversation. 
[$NurseManager]: Oh Marie is here trying to mediate. Let’s leave quietly.  
[$playerName]: Great! Can staff access that as well? 
[$NurseManager]: Yes! Absolutely! Everyone is welcome here. 
[$playerName]: That is perfect! 
[$NurseManager]: All right, shall we go to visit to the activity room.  
//Goes to the activity room
<<SetPath Player Three>><<SetPath Nurse Three>>
[$NurseManager]: We are here! Oh, I think Eve is setting up for the "Tea N’ Talk" program.  
[$playerName]: What’s that? 
[$NurseManager]: Why don’t we ask Eve herself. Hi there Eve! 
[$Char1Last]: Hi [$NurseManager]. Who do we have here? 
[$playerName]: Hi Eve, I’m [$playerName]. I was just going to ask what activity are you planning. 
[$Char1Last]: It’s called “Tea N’ Talk”. The Recreation Staff invite and assist residents to join the program and we discuss “hot” topics in the news or in life.  
[$playerName]: That’s really great. Can I join you one day? 
[$Char1Last]: Absolutely dear! Anyone is welcome here. 
[$playerName]: That is great! 
[$NurseManager]: Thank you Eve! [$playerName], shall we go? Let's go to visit one of the resident’s room. 
[$playerName]: Okay. 
//Goes to one empty private room.
<<SetPath Player Four>><<SetPath Nurse Four>>
[$NurseManager]: This is what a private room looks like. Each room has a bed with a call bell, side table, chair, cabinet and a bathroom. 
[$NurseManager]: Each resident is encouraged to customize their own room to make them feel comfortable and welcomed in their private space. 
[$playerName]: Great! It's really important that the residents can make their room welcoming and comfortable.  
[$NurseManager]: I agree. How about we visit Mr.Wojick's room?
//Goes to Mr. Wojick’s room. 
<<SetPath Player Five>><<SetPath Nurse Five>>

[$Char3Last]:  No! I don’t want to talk to anyone right now. Sorry….can you please leave? 
[$NurseManager]: Alright [$Char3Last]. We understand, maybe another time.  
[$Char3Last]: Yeah.. Sure 
//Leaves the room 
<<Spawn Richard>>
[$NurseManager]:  It is important to respect our resident’s choices. How about we go visit our garden? 
[$playerName]: Sounds good.
