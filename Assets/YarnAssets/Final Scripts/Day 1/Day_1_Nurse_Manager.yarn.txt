[$playerName]: Um... hi there. My name’s [$playerName]. I’m here for the first day of my school placement.
[happy][$NurseManager]: Hello [$playerName]! Welcome, we’ve been expecting you. Ready to get started?
[happy][$playerName]: Yes!
[$NurseManager]: Nervous?
[happy][$playerName]: Yes!!
[happy][$NurseManager]: Ha! That’s to be expected, at least you’re honest! Today I just want you to meet a few of the residents you’ll be working closely with. 
[$NurseManager]: I think you should get started by introducing yourself to [$Char1Last].
[$NurseManager]: I think she’s in the living area. If she’s not too busy perhaps you can ask her to show you around?
[$playerName]: Okay, I will. Thanks!
[happy][$NurseManager]: Good luck!
