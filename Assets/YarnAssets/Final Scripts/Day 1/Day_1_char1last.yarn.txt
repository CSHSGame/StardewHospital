[$Char1Last]: It’s a pleasure to meet you! Please, call me [$Char1First].
[$playerName]: [$NurseManager] was wondering if you could give me a little tour of Bloom Village. Do you think you’d be able to show me around today?

[$playerName]: That’s great!
[$Char1Last]: Follow me, I’ll show you the dining area.
