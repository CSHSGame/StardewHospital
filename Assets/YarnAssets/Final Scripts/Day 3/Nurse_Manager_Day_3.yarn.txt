[$NurseManager]: Good Morning [$playerName]!
[$playerName]: Hello!
[$NurseManager]: Just so you know, [$Char2Last] isn't feeling well today. She's asked us to let her sleep and get some rest.
[$playerName]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that... I wont disturb her.
[$$NurseManager]: Thank you. Would you mind stopping in to see if [$Char2Last] is ready for breakfast?
[$playerName]: Of course, I'll do that now.
[$NurseManager]: See you later!]

[$NurseManager]: Hey there [$playerName]. A package arrived for Mrs. Brown - could you let her know? I think she's in the dining area having lunch.
[$playerName]: I'd be happy to, but I'm not sure I know who she is...
[$NurseManager]: You've probably seen her around - some of her fellow residents affectionately call her 'Mama'.
[$playerName]: Oh yes I know who you mean! I'll let her know.

***Programmer NOte*** player must walk to dining area and find Mama
