[$PlayerName]: Hi there, Mama! [$SupervisorName] asked me to tell you that you have a package.
Mrs. Brown: Excuse me, but who are you calling Mama? I’m not your mama. My name is Mrs. Brown.
[$PlayerName]: I’m really sorry, I just thought… I've heard people call you Mama, so I assumed I could too.
Mrs. Brown: They can call me Mama. That's a nickname some of my closest friends call me by - not strangers.
[$PlayerName]: Again, I’m so sorry, it wasn't very professional of me.
Mrs. Brown: That's alright. Like I said, I'm Mrs Brown - what's your name?
[$PlayerName]: Nice to meet you Mrs. Brown. My name's [$pPlayerName].
Mrs. Brown: A pleasure to meet you [$PlayerName].
[$PlayerName]: Likewise! Anyways, I meant to say you received a package, it's waiting for you in your room. 
Mrs. Brown: Thanks!
