[$NurseManager]: Hi [$playerName].
[$playerName]: Hi [$NurseManager]! I'm sorry I couldn't be here for the LGBTQ+ in service yesterday - how was it? 
[happy][$NurseManager]: It went great, we learned a lot! 
[$playerName]: Do you mind sharing some of the highlights with me? This field is for lifelong learners, so I'm always looking for ways to improve my practice. 
[happy][$NurseManager]: That's inspiring! It was led by an advocate in the community who talked about several LGBTQ+ affirming topics and how to reduce incidences of homophobia in long term care. 
[$NurseManager]: They handed out a booklet which can now be picked up at the resource library.  
[$playerName]: How wonderful! I'll definitely get a hold of that booklet. 
[$NurseManager]: My favorite parts were the talks given by Syd and Richard. They shared their lived experiences, one from the perspective of a closeted resident and the other from the point of view of a significant other. 
[$playerName]: Oh wow – well, thanks for sharing all of that with me. I love how our long-term care culture is changing for the better. 
[$NurseManager]: Absolutely. [$playerName], please follow me to the multi-faith chapel - we're going to be having a discussion with Mrs Stein regarding her palliative treatment - she expressed that she'd like you to be there. 
[$playerName]: Ok.
