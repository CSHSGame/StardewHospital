[$Char1Last]: Hi [$playerName].
[$playerName]: Hey, I hope I'm not late. 
[$Char1Last]: No [$playerName], you're right on time. 
[$NurseManager]: Eve, we’re all here to talk about any changes you’d like to your care plan and any wishes you have in order to make you more comfortable.  Anything you need at all. 
[$Char1Last]: Yes, [$Hana]  would like to ask you about companionship.
[$Hana]: We would like to have 24 hour care and companionship for mom. Can you help to arrange that?
[$NurseManager]: Absolutely! We will provide that information for you. Anything else Eve?
[$Char1Last]: Well… I have been thinking about a few things.  I wonder if you could turn my bed to face the window, so I can feel the sun?  
[$NurseManager]:  We can, of course, rearrange your room if that’s okay with you, [$Katherine] ? 
[$Katherine]: Of course! Anything for my friend. 
[$Char1Last]: You know how I love the ocean.  I know I can’t get there anymore  but it would remind me of happy times there to have a really large picture of the ocean on my wall  . . . 
[$Hana]:  Mom, I’ll enlarge one of your great photos of the ocean. 
[$Char1Last]: That would be wonderful.  And could you bring  all my family photo albums to look through?
[$Char1Last]: I’m too tired to do much talking now but I’d love to listen to more music in my room.  
[$playerName]: I know you love Frank Sinatra, [$Char1First]. Are there any other types of music you’d like?
[$Char1Last]: Hmm... it would be nice to have some of my favourite hymns playing quietly. 
[$NurseManager]: I can have the activation co-ordinator create a playlist for you, [$Char1First], and bring a CD player up to your room.  You can tell me all your favourite hymns and Sinatra songs.
[$Char1Last]: Ha ha, You would probably need more than a list, more likely a book of songs. Of course, I’d rather have Frank Sinatra in person. He was quite a guy. 
[$playerName]: You always make me laugh, Eve.
[$Char1Last]: That’s a great compliment. Thank you!.
[$playerName]: Is there anything else we can do, Eve?
[$Char1Last]: Well, if anyone were to bring in some flowers, I love Gerbera Daisies. 
[$playerName]: I’ll get them!
[$Hana]: Do you think it would be possible for me to stay overnight with my mom?
[$NurseManager]: Of course, you can.  We can put an extra cot in the room. You can be here as much as you like.  
[$Hana]: Thank you.
[$Katherine] : Eve, what about one more Tea ‘n Talk? Maybe just the three of us? 
[$Char1Last]: Oh, yes, [$Katherine] , let's do that. [$playerName], Will you help? 
[$playerName]: I’ll help you have a lovely Tea ‘n Talk for you in your room. What else would you like?
[$Char1Last]: I want you all to know that I’m sad to say good-bye . . . but I have had a wonderful life. 
[$Char1Last]: And I don’t want a funeral when I’m gone.  I want there to plan a celebration of life.
[$NurseManager]: Of course, I would love to help you with the planning. 
[$Char1Last]: Thank you, everyone. [$Hana], I’m quite tired. Let’s you and I go back to my room now.
[$Hana]: Sure mom.
