[$PlayerName]: Hi [$SupervisorName]! I'm sorry I couldn't be here for the LGBTQ+ in service yesterday - how was it? 
[$SupervisorName]: It went great, we learned a lot!  
[$PlayerName]: Do you mind sharing some of the highlights with me? This field is for lifelong learners, so I'm always looking for ways to improve my practice. 
[$SupervisorName]: That's inspiring! It was led by an advocate in the community who talked about several LGBTQ+ affirming topics and how to reduce incidences of homophobia in long term care. 
[$SupervisorName]: They handed out a booklet which can now be picked up at the resource library.  
[$PlayerName]: How wonderful! I'll definitely get a hold of that booklet. 
[$SupervisorName]: My favorite parts were the talks given by Syd and Richard. They shared their lived experiences, one from the perspective of a closeted resident and the other from the point of view of a significant other. 
[$PlayerName]: Oh wow â€“ well, thanks for sharing all of that with me. I love how our long-term care culture is changing for the better. Have a good shift and let me know if you need any help! 
[$SupervisorName]: Thanks, you too.
