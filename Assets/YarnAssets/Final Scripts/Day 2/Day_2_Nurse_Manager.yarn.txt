[$playerName]: Hello! 
[$NurseManager]: Hello [$playerName]! Ready for your second day?
[$playerName]: I think so! [$Char1Last] showed me around yesterday, it was really helpful. 
[$NurseManager]: Great! You should visit her again this first, I think she needs some help setting up for an event. 
[$playerName]: Sure thing.
[$NurseManager]: After that please check in with [$Char2Last], I believe you met him yesterday as well.
[$playerName]: Yes, I did. 
[$NurseManager]: Lastly, please check in with our resident [$Char3First], I think you missed eachother yesterday.
[$playerName]: Okay, I'll do that. 
[$NurseManager]: Thanks! Good luck.
