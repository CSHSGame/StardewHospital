[$PlayerName]: Hi [$StudentName], do you have a moment to talk?
[$StudentName]: Hey [$PlayerName], of course. What’s up?
[$PlayerName]: [$Char3Last] passed away today, and I’m having a really hard time processing it. I got to know her pretty well over the last couple weeks. 
When I found out she died I didn’t feel like I could function properly. Even though I knew she was dying it really caught me off guard. 
[$StudentName]: I’m so sorry to hear that. That is going to be a really difficult reality to face working in long-term care. What were some of your favorite memories of [$Char3First]?
[$PlayerName]:  The other day I helped her set up the tea and talk session...
I loved how excited she was to form bonds with other members of the community her. She was very generous in that way and it was really touching.  
[$StudentName]: That’s great you were able to connect and share that with her. I bet your help and your friendship really meant a lot to her. 
Take your time to process this. Remember that you brought something special into this person’s life, and it seems like you learned a lot. 
[$PlayerName]: Thanks [$StudentName], I feel a lot better being able to talk about it. It’s just really hard right now. Thanks for being there.
