[$Susannah]:  Hi [$playerName]!  my name's Susannah , I'm [$Char5Last]'s daughter - we met the other day. 
[$playerName]: Of course! How's it going?
[$Susannah]: I'm worried my mother isn't eating properly - she never ate western food at home and I don't think she's used to it.

[$playerName]: Oh [$NurseManager], you're here! I was just going to go find you. Susannah wanted to ask you about making some adjustments to [$Char5Last]'s meal plan.
[$NurseManager]: Of course! How can I help? 
[$Susannah]: I’m concerned about my mother's health... Brian and I are worried she’s not eating her meals. 
[$NurseManager]: Hmm, well it’s only been a few days since she moved in - sometimes a change like that can affect a person's appetite.
[$Susannah]: Sure, but I think it also has to do with the type of food here. At home, she would have authentic Chinese meals - that’s what she’s eaten all her life.
[$NurseManager]: Of course. Thanks for letting us know - I’ll have the dietician stop by with a meal plan survey to see what choices might best fit your mom. 
[$Susannah]: Okay, thank you!
[$NurseManager]: However, I should say because we have residents from many different cultural backgrounds, we try our best to accommodate everyone’s preferences.  
[$NurseManager]: We try to offer alternatives and some family members bring in a resident's favorite foods from home to supplement our menu after consulting with the dietitian.
[$Susannah]: I didn’t know we could do that. We can certainly bring her some home-cooked meals. 
[$NurseManager]: There's one other thing - it's a new program here. The residents learn to cook from around the world and share their cultural recipes.  I think your mom would enjoy it.
[$Susannah]: 妈妈，她说这里有烹饪班！ 您想学习烹饪来自世界各地的不同食物吗？ 
[happy][$Char5Last]: 是的，我喜欢做饭！
[$Susannah]: [$playerName], my mother said she likes to cook and I think that she would like to attend this program.
[$Susannah]:  妈妈，这节课是在星期三，节目的工作人员会来接你。 你可以结交新朋友，分享你在中国的名菜。
[$Char5Last]: 他们不会喜欢我。 我不会说英语
[$Susannah]: She doesn’t feel like she belongs here. Katherine is warm and friendly but mom feels she has no one to talk to.  
[[Tell her I’ll go to the class with her with my translation device or we will have a volunteer translate for your mom during the class.|Day_13_Class_True]] <<$Transitioning_Class = true>> 
[[It’s really important for you to try all our activities, Mrs. Lee. You can’t just stay in your room all the time.|Day_13_Class_False]] <<$Transitioning_Class = false>>

[$Susannah]: 告訴她我會和她一起上課 - 用我的翻譯裝置 - 或者我們會有一個志願者在課堂上為你的媽媽講粵語。
[$Char5Last]: Okay!
[$Susannah]: Thank you, that would be great. I think mom's going to love the cooking class.
[$Char5Last]: 我会尝试。

[$Susannah]: 李女士，嘗試我們所有的活動對你來說非常重要。你不能一直呆在自己的房間裡。 
[$Char5Last]: 沒有。
[$NurseManager]: Um, I think what [$playerName] means is that we can accomadate any communication gaps with the other residents. 
[$NurseManager]: We can use the tablet to translate for her,or try to have a volunteer who speaks Cantonese to translate for your mom during the class.
