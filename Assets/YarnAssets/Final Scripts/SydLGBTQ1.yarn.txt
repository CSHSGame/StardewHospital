[$playerName]: [$Char3First], May I come in?
[$Char3First]: Come in.
[$playerName]: Hi there, Mr.Wojcik.  My name is [$playerName] I wanted to introduce myself and help you get ready for the day, if I can. Music therapy is this morning. I heard you were a musician.  Would you like to go? 
[$Char3First]: Hello ... I don’t think I feel like going out today.
[$playerName]: You sure?
[[Ok, I'll see you later|Pier]]<<$LGBTQ_DEC1_WRONG = true>>

[[Okay Syd, I understand, I will check in with you tomorrow. Have a great day!|Pier]]<<$LGBTQ_DEC1_RIGHT = true>>

** Knock Knock **
[$Char3First]: It's open.
[$playerName]: Hey Syd, how's it going today?
[$Char3First]: Okay. But 'no thank you' to whatever's on today. I don't feel like doing anything.
[$playerName]: You seem to be a little down. Can I ask if anything’s troubling you?
[$Char3First]: I’d just rather stay here and read...  
[$playerName]: I know you enjoy reading, that's really great. Someone mentioned to me that you play the violin, too. There’s a strings concert after lunch today, I thought you might like to go.
[$Char3First]: ...I don’t think so.
[$playerName]: Some of the other residents really love music as well - it could be a great chance to get to know some of them. 
[$Char3First]: No... I find it awkward talking with the other residents. 
[$playerName]: Can you tell me more about that?  Is it okay if I sit down?” 
---NOTE TO PROGRAMMERS: The player sits down
[$Char3First]: They’re nice enough. But they’re always asking me about my “wife.”  When I say I don’t have a wife they say: ‘Oh, sorry, Syd.  You’re a widower? Or divorced?’ Or just you never met the right woman?  When I said ‘No, that's not it”, one guy said  ‘Ah, so you’re a “bachelor!" with his eyebrows raised.  They’re so nosey. I’m tired of it. I'd rather just stay here. 
[$playerName]: It sounds like you don’t like their questions. I’d really like to help you feel more comfortable here. 
[$Char3First]: Don’t worry about it. The other residents just haven’t bothered to get to know me...   
[$playerName]: What would you like the other residents to know about you?
[$Char3First]: Don’t worry about it. The other residents just haven’t bothered to get to know me...   
[$Char3First]: ...
[$Char3First]: I really miss my best friend.
[$playerName]: Tell me about that.
[$Char3First]: His name is Richard - you've probably seen him here, he visits me a lot.
[$playerName]: Yes, I think we met the other day.
[$Char3First]: It's great to have him visit, but before I came here we used to live together - we spent almost all our time together.
[$playerName]: It must be hard to feel like you don’t have anyone here you can talk to. 
[$Char3First]: Yeah, it’s a big change from being at home. Until I had to use this wheelchair to get around, I was pretty independent. 
[$playerName]: It’s a big adjustment, Syd. Can you tell me a little more about Richard?
[$Char3First]: ...
[$Char3First]: We live together for almost forty years. He’s more than my best friend, he’s my partner – my life partner. But it became harder and harder for him looking after me. He has some health issues of his own.
Decision point: 
[[What?! You’re gay?! Syd I had no idea!|LGBTQ_SECOND_DAY_DEC_1_WRONG]]
[[Oh, that’s not a big deal. You don’t need to worry about that.|LGBTQ_SECOND_DAY_DEC_1_WRONG]]
[[Moving here has separated you from Richard - now I understand why you don’t feel comfortable here..|LGBTQ_SECOND_DAY_DEC_1_RIGHT]]

[$Char3First]: Ugh, you're as bad as the rest of them! I regret telling you any of this. 
[$playerName]: [$Char3First], I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

[$Char3First]: That’s exactly right.  It feels like the 1950's again in here! Like no one here has ever met a gay man before.

[$playerName]: It sounds like you feel you have to hide who you are to fit in here. Is that how you're feeling?
[$Char3First]: **Points to his displayed photos** I mean, look at this room. Richard and I spent our lives together and I haven’t even put out any pictures of us together. 
[$playerName]: This is your home now, [$Char3First]. It's important that you have meaningful personal items around you so you feel comfortable here. 
[$Char3First]: Yeah, sure... but... I don’t think our relationship would be accepted here. It seems like everyone here is required to be heterosexual.
[$playerName]: I’m just a placement student, [$Char3First], I don't have much authority here -  but I’m concerned about your situation. Would it be alright if I shared what you’ve told me with my supervisor so they know your concerns? 
[$Char3First]: Okay.  I guess.   
[$playerName]: I don’t think a person should ever have to hide who they are, [$Char3First]. 
[$Char3First]: I appreciate that. I spent too long in the closet as a young man. I’m not going back in now that I’m old! 
[$playerName]: I’ll tell my supervisor when we meet later.  In the meantime, how about the concert after lunch?  Would you like me to come by, we can go together.
[$Char3First]: That sounds good to me, thank you.

Wrong Answer- Oh, I’m sorry, you’re busy. I’ll come back later.
                Supervisor: Okay. 
[[Hi, I was just talking with [$Char3First]...|LGBTQ_SECOND_DAY_HALLWAY_WRONG]]

****PROGRAMMER NOTE****  They walk to the office or another private space
[$playerName]: So, [$Char3First] hasn’t been coming to any activities since he moved in. We got to talking and he telling me how sad and isolated he feels. Syd's gay, but he hasn't told and of the other staff or residents because he doesn't feel like he'll be accepted here. He told me that his friend Richard who comes to visit him most days is actally [$Char3First]’s life partner. They lived together for 40 years. He doesn't think they can be open about their relationship - he feels link only heterosexual people are welcomed here. 
[$SupervisorName]: I’m so sorry to hear that.  It sounds like you made a good connection with [$Char3First] - he must have felt he could trust you enough to tell you how he was feeling. I think the next step would be to involve our inter-professional team and discuss how we should proceed. 
[$playerName]: Can I let Syd know we'll arrange a meeting?
[$SupervisorName]: Yes please [$playerName], thanks very much.

****PROGRAMMERS NOTE - THE PLAYER WALKS BACK TO SYD'S ROOM AND HIS DOOR IS OPEN
[$playerName]: Hey [$Char3First], I spoke with my supervisor, she was really concerned to here about your situation. She's going to arrange a meeting with you and some key members of the faculty here. How does that sound?
[$Char3First]: Great,  Richard will come, too.
[[I don’t think so.  It’s a confidential meeting, Richard wont be able to attend.|LGBTQ_SECOND_DAY_SYDS_ROOM_WRONG]]
[[Don’t bother, that isn't necessary. You can update him after the meeting!|LGBTQ_SECOND_DAY_SYDS_ROOM_WRONG2]]

[$playerName]: Okay, you're right, I'm sorry about that. Someone will let you know when the meeting is scheduled, I think it will probably be in the next day or two.<<$LGBTQ_SECOND_DAY_SYDS_ROOM_RIGHT = false>>

**** PROGRAMMER NOTE -- PLAYER ARRIVES AT SYDS ROOM - SOCIAL WORKER SUPERVISOR AND PROGRAM MANAGER ARE THERE
[$Char3First]: Hey [$playerName]! You're just in time.
[$playerName]: Hi there, [$Char3First].
[$Char3First]: This is Richard, my partner 
[$playerName]: Hi Richard!  Nice to see you again.
[$Char3First]: Richard, [$playerName] is the student I was telling you about.
Richard: [$Char3First] told me how supportive you’ve been. 
[$Char3First]: I was just getting introduced to the Program Manager [$DirName], Dana, a Social Worker. [$SupervisorName] I know well of course.
[$DirName]: Let’s all have a seat.
[$SocialWorker]: So, Richard and [Char3Name],  I heard you two have been together for forty years?
[$Char3First]: That’s right. We met working at the same law firm in our thirties. We loved a lot of the same things- music, books, travel... we fell in love and we’ve been together ever since.
[$SocialWorker]:   How wonderful for you both.  It must be difficult to be separated now.
[$SupervisorName]: We really appreciate your willingness to talk to us about your concerns. We are striving to create a comfortable and respectful environment for all of our residents, but I understand you haven’t felt welcome here. 
[$Char3First]: I’m afraid not. 
[$SocialWorker]: It must be uncomfortable for you to feel you have to hide your sexual orientation and your relationship with Richard from the staff and residents here.
[$Char3First]: It took me long enough to open up about this when I was young. Richard and I have always been a proud ‘out’ couple, but when I moved in here it felt like I was going back in time.  But I’ve decided I’m not going back in the closet again, not at this stage of my life.  
[$DirName]: We don’t want you to, [$Char3First]. We need your suggestions on what we can do to change the culture here so you feel comfortable and safe. 
Richard: I think you need to educate yourself and the staff first!
[$Char3First]: I just expect people to treat me with dignity and respect. 
[$SocialWorker]: Have you not felt treated that way?
[$Char3First]: Well, when I was admitted, a lot of the language in the admission form assumes the resident is heterosexual.  
[$SupervisorName]: So we need to change our Admission Form? 
Richard: You need to change a lot more than that!  All the written material assumes everyone is straight. 
[$Char3First]: And I could only chose between “male” and “female.” What if the resident is transgender?  You could let people simply write down their gender, and ask about their preferred pronoun.   
Richard: There isn’t a Pride flag or an inclusive poster displayed anywhere here.
[$Char3First]: For anyone who is gay, lesbian, bi or trans here, you just feel invisible.
[$DirName]: That must be very difficult and uncomfortable. That needs to change. 
[$Char3First]: Thank you for saying so. 
[$DirName]: Are there any changes we can do make for you personally?  Here, in your room?
[$Char3First]: I'd like to post photos of my adventures with Richard in my Memory Box. We've travelled to over 60 countries together! 
[$SocialWorker]: We can change the photos whenever you’re ready! 
Richard: It’ll be hard to choose. We have nineteen albums! [laughs]
[$Char3First]: Richard is the avid photographer of our family.
[$playerName]: I can’t wait to see your pictures. 
[$SocialWorker]: Great! What else?
Richard: There are a lot of changes that can happen to make to make this a place where the LGBTQ+ community feels welcome and safe.  It’s called creating a “Positive Space.” 
[$DirName]: I see we have a lot to learn. There aren’t regulations in place in Ontario at this time to ensure appropriate accommodation for LGBTQ+ residents, [$Char3First], but there is a Bill of Rights for Residents in Long-Term Care. This Bill of Rights ensures that long-term care homes are truly homes for the people who live in them and that residents know their rights. I'll leave a copy here for you - I think you’ll find it useful.   
[$Char3First]: Thanks very much.  I didn’t know there was a Bill of Rights for Long-Term Care.  
[$DirName]: Good. Thanks so much for meeting with us, [$Char3First] and Richard. 
Richard: And thank all of you for listening!
[$SupervisorName]: We’ll be in touch soon.

[$SupervisorName]: What a productive meeting with [$Char3First] and Richard! I certainly learned a lot. 
[$playerName]: I learned how important it is to make this environment an inclusive, comfortable and safe space where all of our residents feel welcome. I never considered how important it is for all our forms and paper-work to use gender-neutral language.  
[$playerName]: Personally, I also learned that by paying close attention to [$Char3First], by really listening to him and showing empathy it helped him open up and tell me how he was really feeling and what he needed.  
[$SocialWorker]:  It’s clear that we need to educate ourselves and all our staff to create a 'positive space', as Richard said.  I’m going research what other Long-Term Care homes are doing to be LGBTQ+-friendly. I’ll talk to our Director of Care and put together a presentation for a staff in-service as soon as possible. 
[$SupervisorName]: Perfect! Keep me updated me on your progress.
