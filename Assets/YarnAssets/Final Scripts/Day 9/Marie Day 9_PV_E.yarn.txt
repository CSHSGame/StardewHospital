[$Char4FirstDoor]: Knock Knock
[$playerName]: Marie? Are you there? It’s me, [$playerName].
[$Char4First]: Come in.
[$playerName]: Ok, I’m coming in… 
[$playerName]: just opening the door… 
[$playerName]: and coming in to the room now...
[$Char4First]: You can come right in.
<<SetPath Controller Zero>> //The player enters the room
[$playerName]: Ok! Here I am.
[$Char4First]: Hmm, yes, here you are.
[$playerName]: So! [$Char4First], I just wanted to apologize for the other day, barging in here. I know this is your home and I want to respect your privacy and I should have gotten your consent before entering. 
[$Char4First]: My dear, mistakes happen. I wasn’t upset with you for walking in on my companion and I. If anything it’s been your behaviour since then that I find a bit bothersome. 
[[[$playerName]: What do you mean? What's wrong with my behaviour?!!|Sexuality_Defense]]<<$Sexuality_Defensive = true>>

[$playerName]: I can't believe they’re  allowed to do that in here.
[$NurseManager]: Do what? ... What did you see?
[$playerName]: I’m not sure but I think they were having sex!  
[$NurseManager]: Well, they’re adults, you know. Just because they live in long-term care doesn’t mean they have to give up their rights. This is their home. 
[$playerName]: But they're as old as my grandparents!
[$NurseManager]: Our responsibility is to make sure that residents are safe but they also have a right to privacy, even though it’s not always possible to find privacy here!
[$playerName]: ...
[$NurseManager]: You seem upset, but I think it's rather beautiful when our residents can find some closeness and intimacy here . . .  
[$playerName]: I guess. But I feel really uncomfortable. It's like I walked in on my grandmother making out with an old guy.
[$NurseManager]: [$playerName], we need our students to understand that older adults are human - they're sexual beings just like anyone else.   We need to cut across all the hurtful stereotypes about growing old. I want you to have this - it's an article that I want you to read.  I think you’ll find it helpful.  
[action]*[$NurseManager] Hands player document *
[$playerName]: Okay... I do have a quick question before you go.  How do we know what Marie is doing is consensual?
[$NurseManager]: That’s a great question. The staff know from our ongoing assessments which residents are fully capable of making such personal decisions. Marie is quite able to make decisions for herself.
[$playerName]: Thanks, [$NurseManager]. I’ll read this tonight.
