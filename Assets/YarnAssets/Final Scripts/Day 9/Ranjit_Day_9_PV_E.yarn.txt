[$Ranjit]: Whoa hold on! We shouldn't be discussing something like that here - we need to go somewhere private. Let's go to the garden.
[[What's the big deal! Lets talk here.|Sexuality_Talk_Here]]

//Student and Player are in the garden.
[$playerName]: You’re not going to believe this! I saw one of my residents kissing another resident. She must be in her eighties!
[$Ranjit]: Good for her.  I just hope I’m that frisky when I’m her age.
[$playerName]: C’mon, don't you think it’s weird? Kind of yucky?  I was so embarrassed. 
[$Ranjit]: You need to loosen up a little [$playerName]. Remember that we’re not here to judge any resident.  We’re here to  support and respect their decisions,  as long as they’re safe.  I’m sure the resident knows what she’s doing.
[$playerName]: I guess you're right. I should get back to work…
[$Ranjit]: Oh there's Marie now, talking to Joe.
<<SetPath Marie One>>
<<SetPath Joe One>>
[$Joe]: [$Char4First]! Give ol' Joe a hug.
[$Char4First]: No, Joe.  I’m not a big hugger. How about a handshake? 
[$Ranjit]: See, it looks like [$Char4First] knows how to set her own boundaries. 
[$playerName]: Yeah, that’s great!  I guess it's reassuring to see her say ‘No’ to something that makes her feel uncomfortable. Thanks for the support [$Ranjit]!
[$playerName]: Umm, hi Marie! I didn't have a chance to ask you this morning if you’re coming to Laughter Yoga tomorrow.
[$Char4First]: Sure! Thanks, darling, I’ll see you there.
[$playerName]: Bye.
