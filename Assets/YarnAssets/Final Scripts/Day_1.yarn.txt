[$PlayerName]: Um.. hi there. My name’s [$PlayerName], I’m here for the first day of my school placement,
[$NurseManager]: Hello [$PlayerName]! Welcome, we’ve been expecting you. Ready to get started?
[$PlayerName]: Yes!
[$NurseManager]: Nervous?
[$PlayerName]: Yes!!
[$NurseManager]: Ha! That’s to be expected, at least you’re honest! Today I just want you to meet a few of the residents you’ll be working closely with. I think you get started by introducing yourself to [$Char1Last]  - I think she’s in the living area. If she’s not to busy perhaps you can ask her to show you around?
[$PlayerName]: Okay, I will. Thanks!
[$NurseManager]: Good luck!

[$PlayerName]: Hi, sorry to interrupt - I’m looking for [$Char1Last]?
[$Char1Last]: That’s me! 
[$PlayerName]: Hello! My name is [$PlayerName], [$NurseManager] wanted me to come by and introduce myself - I’m the new placement student and today is my first day. 
[$Char1Last]: It’s a pleasure to meet you! Please, call me [$Char1First].
[$PlayerName]: [$NurseManager] was wondering if you could give me a little tour of Bloom Village - do you think you’d be able to show me around today?
[$Char1Last]: Sure! I have some time now - shall we? This is the living area, it’s a common space for residents to sit and chat, read or socialize.
[$PlayerName]: That’s great!
[$Char1Last]: Follow me, I’ll show you the dining area.

[$Char1Last]: [$Char2Last], I want to introduce you to our new placement student, [$PlayerName].
[$PlayerName]: Hello, [$Char2Last],  nice to meet you. 
[$Char1Last]: [$Char2Last] used to be a chef! We’re still trying to convince him to cook us up a meal! Haha.
[$Char2Last]: Haha! I used to be, I don’t cook much these days though.
[$Char1Last]: I’m just giving [$PlayerName] a small tour of Bloom Village, see you later [$Char2Last]!

[$PlayerName]: He seemed really nice!
[$Char1Last]: [$Char2Last] is a real sweetheart. He’s been struggling with dementia for the last few years. Sometimes he’s really easy to get along with, like just now, but sometimes he can be more unpredictable. 
[$PlayerName]: Oh, I had no idea…
