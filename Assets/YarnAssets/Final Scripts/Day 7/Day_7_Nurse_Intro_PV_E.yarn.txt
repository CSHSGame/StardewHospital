[$playerName]: Good morning.
[$NurseManager]: Hey [$playerName], how are you feeling today? I know that conversation with [$Char1First] yesterday was very difficult for you. 
[$playerName]: It was, thanks you for asking. I'm alright though. 
[$NurseManager]: I'm sorry to say she's not feeling well at all today, I don't think you'll be able to visit.
[$NurseManager]: But one of the other students, Ranjit, was looking for you. 
[$playerName]: Okay, I'll touch base with him, thanks.
