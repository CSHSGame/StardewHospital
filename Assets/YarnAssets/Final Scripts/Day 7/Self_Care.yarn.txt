[$playerName]: Hi Ranjit! I haven't seen you in a while - how's your student placement going?
[$Ranjit]: Ugh please -- don’t even try to talk to me! I’m in such a bad mood today…
[$playerName]: Hmmm... What’s wrong?
[$Ranjit]: *sigh* I just came back from giving a bath to the new resident and half of it was spent trying to stop her from crying… 
[$Ranjit]: It took every ounce of strength not to breakdown and cry myself. 
[$playerName]: You've been having a tough time?
[$Ranjit]: This job is just too much… I’m so physically and emotionally exhausted all the time… 
[$Ranjit]: Some days I just feel like I’m going to collapse. I don't have the energy for this anymore.
[$playerName]: Ranjit, it sounds like you're burnt out.
[$Ranjit]: I don’t know… what does burnout feel like?
[$playerName]: It can happen when we get really stressed. 
[$playerName]: Some signs of burnout are fatigue, forgetfulness, insomnia, loss of appetite, lack of energy and focus.
[$playerName]: It can even increase the chance of illness.
[$Ranjit]: That’s exactly how I’ve been for the past three months…
[$playerName]: This is a tough job and we all have to learn to manage our stress. Stress management and burnout prevention are very important. 
[$playerName]:Luckily, we have an employee wellness program here at [$HospitalName]. I really recommend going to the office and speaking with someone. 
[$playerName]We need to practice self-care, not just for ourselves, but so that we can better take care of our residents.
[$Ranjit]: Thanks [$playerName], that's really valuable advice. I appreciate you listening and being understanding.
[$playerName] Of course.
