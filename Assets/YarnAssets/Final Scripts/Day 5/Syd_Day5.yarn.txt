**** PROGRAMMER NOTE -- PLAYER ARRIVES AT SYDS ROOM - SOCIAL WORKER SUPERVISOR AND PROGRAM MANAGER ARE THERE
[happy][$Char3First]: Hey [$playerName]! You're just in time.
[happy][$playerName]: Hi there, [$Char3First].
[$Char3First]: This is Richard, my partner 
[$playerName]: Hi Richard!  Nice to see you again.
[$Char3First]: Richard, [$playerName] is the student I was telling you about.
Richard: [$Char3First] told me how supportive you’ve been. 
[$Char3First]: I was just getting introduced to the Program Manager [$DirName], Dana, a Social Worker. [$SupervisorName] I know well of course.
[$DirName]: Let’s all have a seat.
[$SocialWorker]: So, Richard and [$Char3First],  I heard you two have been together for forty years?
[Right][$Char3First]: That’s right. We met working at the same law firm in our thirties. We loved a lot of the same things- music, books, travel... we fell in love and we’ve been together ever since.
[$SocialWorker]:   How wonderful for you both.  It must be difficult to be separated now.
[$SupervisorName]: We really appreciate your willingness to talk to us about your concerns. We are striving to create a comfortable and respectful environment for all of our residents, but I understand you haven’t felt welcome here. 
[sad][Right][$Char3First]: I’m afraid not. 
[$SocialWorker]: It must be uncomfortable for you to feel you have to hide your sexual orientation and your relationship with Richard from the staff and residents here.
[Right][$Char3First]: It took me long enough to open up about this when I was young. Richard and I have always been a proud ‘out’ couple, but when I moved in here it felt like I was going back in time.
[Right][$Char3First]: But I’ve decided I’m not going back in the closet again, not at this stage of my life.
[$DirName]: We don’t want you to, [$Char3First]. We need your suggestions on what we can do to change the culture here so you feel comfortable and safe. 
Richard: I think you need to educate yourself and the staff first!
[Right][$Char3First]: I just expect people to treat me with dignity and respect. 
[$SocialWorker]: Have you not felt treated that way?
[Right][$Char3First]: Well, when I was admitted, a lot of the language in the admission form assumes the resident is heterosexual.  
[$SupervisorName]: So we need to change our Admission Form? 
Richard: You need to change a lot more than that!  All the written material assumes everyone is straight. 
[Right][$Char3First]: And I could only chose between “male” and “female.” What if the resident is transgender?  You could let people simply write down their gender, and ask about their preferred pronoun.   
[sad]Richard: There isn’t a Pride flag or an inclusive poster displayed anywhere here.
[Right][$Char3First]: For anyone who is gay, lesbian, bi or trans here, you just feel invisible.
[$DirName]: That must be very difficult and uncomfortable. That needs to change. 
[happy][Right][$Char3First]: Thank you for saying so. 
[$DirName]: Are there any changes we can do make for you personally?  Here, in your room?
[Right][$Char3First]: I'd like to post photos of my adventures with Richard in my Memory Box. We've travelled to over 60 countries together! 
[$SocialWorker]: We can change the photos whenever you’re ready! 
Richard: It’ll be hard to choose. We have nineteen albums! [laughs]
[Right][$Char3First]: Richard is the avid photographer of our family.
[$playerName]: I can’t wait to see your pictures. 
[$SocialWorker]: Great! What else?
Richard: There are a lot of changes that can happen to make to make this a place where the LGBTQ+ community feels welcome and safe.  It’s called creating a “Positive Space.” 
[$DirName]: I see we have a lot to learn. There aren’t regulations in place in Ontario at this time to ensure appropriate accommodation for LGBTQ+ residents, [$Char3First], but there is a Bill of Rights for Residents in Long-Term Care.
[DirName]: This Bill of Rights ensures that long-term care homes are truly homes for the people who live in them and that residents know their rights. I'll leave a copy here for you - I think you’ll find it useful.
[Right][$Char3First]: Thanks very much.  I didn’t know there was a Bill of Rights for Long-Term Care.  
[$DirName]: Good. Thanks so much for meeting with us, [$Char3First] and Richard. 
[happy]Richard: And thank all of you for listening!
[$SupervisorName]: We’ll be in touch soon.
