[$NurseManager]: Come, let’s talk.
Skip:
[action]*The [$NurseManager] and [$playerName] leave [$Char1Last]’ room and walk to the nursing station.*
Skip:
[$NurseManager]: I see you’re a little upset, [$playerName].
Skip:
[$playerName]: I didn’t know what to do! I kept trying to explain to [$Char1Last] where he was, but he kept saying he wanted to leave. I said he couldn’t go, and he got angry with me. I almost grabbed his arm to stop him.
Skip:
[$NurseManager]: He was frustrated because you didn’t understand what he wanted.
Skip:
[$playerName]: I was frustrated that he didn’t understand me no matter how many times I told him.
Skip:
[$NurseManager]: Repeating things won’t help him. Because of his dementia, his mind doesn’t process information the same way anymore. I’m very relieved that you remembered that under no circumstances are you to physically restrain a resident or grab his hand, or yell or raise your voice.
Skip:
[$playerName]: What should I have done?
Skip:
[$NurseManager]: Just be present with him. Don’t try to change his mind. You saw me provide redirection by talking about his wife. As you get to know [$Char1Last], you’ll learn more about him - and each resident’s life - before they had dementia - so that you can talk to each person in a personal way about their life. This will help you to understand why our residents may respond to their new life here with frustration and how we can find ways to help them feel more comfortable living here.  The most important thing as you’re getting to know each resident is to always remain calm, and don’t react. Apologize and distract them with conversation, give  yourself space to cool down and reflect on what was behind the responsive behaviour.
Skip:
[action]*The [$NurseManager] gives the PS a booklet.*
Skip:
[$NurseManager]: Here, I want you to read this.  I think it will be very helpful.
Skip:
[$playerName]: Okay, I will. Thank you!
