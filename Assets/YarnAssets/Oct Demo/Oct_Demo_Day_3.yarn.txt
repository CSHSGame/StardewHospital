[$playerName]: What's the special on the menu today?

[action]*[$Char1Last] and [$playerName] are in his room.*
Skip:
[$playerName]: So, tell me why you love cooking so much? All I can make is bad shepherd's pie and burnt toast.
Skip:
[$Char1Last]: Oh, dear. Well, I got my love of cooking from my grandma. I loved her food so much. I learned how to cook from watching her.
Skip:
[$playerName]: Wow, she must have been a great cook!
Skip:
[$Char1Last]: Yes. Then, my birth family sent me to Canada. My adopted family owned a restaurant, and the rest was history.

[$Char1Last]: It was World War II. Britain was under attack by the enemy. The men were called to the trenches, the women to the factories. As for the children, they put us on ships headed to Australia or Canada for our safety. Those were hard times.
Skip:
[$playerName]: It sounds like it. How were your adopted family? 
Skip:
[$Char1Last]: My adopted father taught me how to figure out the business side of running a restaurant. I was a fast learner. I moved from waiter all the way to head chef in no time.
Skip:
[$playerName]: Wow, I didn't know you were so talented, [$Char1Last].
Skip:
[$Char1Last]: Haha! It was hard work!
Skip:
[$playerName]: It's no wonder the chef here requested your professional opinion of the new dish on our menu.
Skip:
[$Char1Last]: Really?
Skip:
[$playerName]: I'm on my way to the dining room. Would you like to lead me there?
Skip:
[$Char1Last]: I'd be happy to.
Skip:
[action]*They walk toward the dining room.*
