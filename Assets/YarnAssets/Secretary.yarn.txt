Secretary: Mr Martin can seem a little gruff at first - he used to be in the military. He likes things to be organized and straightforward. He’s 84 and suffers from dementia -he has difficulty recognizing people, sometimes even the people he’s closest to. Be sure to communicate clearly with him about who you are and why you’re there.

Mr Youssaf is really sweet, but is suffering from the early effects of Alzheimer's.  His wife passed away two years ago - a fact he often forgets. You’ll need to be delicate around that issue - confronting him directly can put him in an agitated state.

Mrs Stein has been here longer than any of our clients, she’s really beloved by the staff here. Sadly, her doctors feel she may be in the last weeks of her life… She has understandable been feeling pretty down.
