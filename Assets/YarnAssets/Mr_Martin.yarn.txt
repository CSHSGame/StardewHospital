That's quite alright, nice to see a new face around here. Say, if you're here tomorrow I'd love to show you around Baycrest.
-> That sounds great, I'll be around tomorrow afternoon, let's try to make that happen.
    Mr. Martin: Um.. ok.. I guess I'll see you sometime.<<set $vague_Martin = true>>
-> Sounds good, how about 1pm?
    Mr.Martin: Excellent, 1300 sharp then.<<set $1pm_Martin = true>>
    -> ....that means 1, right?
        Mr. Martin: Yes sir it most certainly does.        
-> Ok, let me discuss my schedule with my supervisor, and I'll let you know what a good time would be. 
    Of course! Chain of command is very important. <<set $1will_confirm_Martin = true>>
-> Sure, what would be a good time for you?
    Mr.Martin: 7am.<<set $7am_Martin = true>>
    -> Hm.. Ok then, bright and early.
Mr. Martin: Alright then, until tomorrow.
-> Great, see you then.
-> Take care, it was nice to see you.<<set $talked_to_Martin = true>>
