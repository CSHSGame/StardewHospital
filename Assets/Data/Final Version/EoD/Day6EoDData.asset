  DecisionPoint1Outcome2Text: Today you faced a difficult situation when Mrs. Stein
    opened up to you about her feelings. Given her recent health crisis she is trying
    to come to terms with a terminal illness - you interjected with your own thoughts
    and feelings, when the appropriate decision would have been to just let her speak
    while listening attentively. Please keep that in mind next time.
