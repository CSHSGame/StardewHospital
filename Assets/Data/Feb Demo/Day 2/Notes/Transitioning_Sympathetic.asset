  VariableTrue: " When Susannah confided in you that she was feeling guilt about moving
    her mother into long term care, you responded by listening attentively and expressing
    sympathy, which was just what the situation called for. We don\u2019t always need
    to offer advise or anecdotes from our own lives - just being there for someone
    and letting them talk through their emotions is often enough. \r\n"
  VariableFalse: "When Susannah confided in you that she was feeling guilt about moving
    her mother into long term care, your response was completely inappropriate, and
    only made her feel worse about the situation. What she needed in that situation
    was for you to simply listen and empathise. \r\n"
