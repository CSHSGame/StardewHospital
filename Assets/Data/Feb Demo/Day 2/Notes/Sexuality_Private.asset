  VariableTrue: " When you were speaking to Jeff about [$Char4Last] today, it\u2019s
    great that you chose to move the conversation to a more private location. Because
    we\u2019re in constant communication with our co-workers about our residents,
    it\u2019s easy to forget to take their privacy into account - remember to use
    discretion and care when it comes to discussing our residents with co-workers.\r\n"
  VariableFalse: "When you were speaking to Jeff today, you were careless in discussing
    private information about one of our residents in a public place - he was correct
    to stop you and move the conversation to a place where you could speak in private.
    Because we\u2019re in constant communication with our co-workers about our residents,
    it\u2019s easy to forget to take their privacy into account - remember to use
    discretion and care when it comes to discussing our residents.\r\n"
