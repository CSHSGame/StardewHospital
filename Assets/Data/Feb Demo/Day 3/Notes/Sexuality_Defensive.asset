  VariableTrue: "Today [$Char4Last] raised an issue she was having with you - that
    your behaviour around her had been awkward and immature. In response you became
    defensive and evasive - this is not the way you should respond when a resident
    (or anyone else!) confronts you about your behaviour. It\u2019s okay to make mistakes,
    but if you\u2019re not receptive when someone gives you criticism, you\u2019ll
    end up making the same mistakes againa and again. \r\n"
  VariableFalse: " Today [$Char4Last] raised an issue she was having with you - that
    your behaviour around her had been awkward and immature. It\u2019s great that
    you were able to take in what she had to say and apologize, instead of being defensive.
    It\u2019s okay to make mistakes once in a while, but if you\u2019re not receptive
    when someone gives you criticism, you\u2019ll end up making the same mistakes
    againa and again. \r\n"
