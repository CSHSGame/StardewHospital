[$Susannah]: See mom, this is such a nice place. 
[$Susannah]: I see you'll have a room-mate - I think that's fantastic.  You’re not going to be alone. 
[$SupervisorName]: We’re going to do our best to make Mrs. Lee comfortable. We have an excellent team here that will work together to address all her needs. And this is our Placement Student [$PlayerName], they're going to help her settle into her new room.
[$PlayerName]: Hi, Mrs. Lee.  It’s good to meet you.    
[$SupervisorName]:  Susannah, I'd like to speak with you and your husband for a few minutes - can we go to my office?  We’ll be back in a few minutes.

[$SocialWorkerName]: Hello everyone. It’s good to see you. I know this transition can be difficult for all of you - and for [$Char5Last] most of all. But with the tablet we can communicate with her in Cantonese. Our hope is that this will help your mom communicate her needs and to be more comfortable.

[$Katherine]:  Hello [$Char5Last], nice to meet you.  Hello, Susannah - I’m happy to meet you. 
[$Susannah]: It’s good to meet you, too. But I’m afraid my mother is feeling upset about this move.
[$Katherine]: 	That’s understandable.  Most people feel anxious about moving to a new home - I was certainly very nervous when I moved in here. 
[$Katherine]: I’ll do my best to help her feel safe and comfortable here.

[$Susannah]: They left everything behind.  He couldn’t come with us today because he is too emotional about it.  It’s my fault.

[$SupervisorName]: Can I be of some help?
[$PlayerName]: Yes Please! [$Char5Last] seems to need something urgently but I don't know what she's saying.
[$SupervisorName]: Well, that's one of the reasons we keep these tablets here! You can use a website to translate between Cantonese and English, and vice versa.
[$PlayerName]: Oh! That sounds extremely helpful! Let me give it a try..
[$PlayerName]: [$Char5Last], what's wrong? How can we help you??
[$Tablet]: 怎麼了？我們該怎樣幫助你*
[$Char5Last]:!!!
[$Char5Last]: 我的女兒離開了。跟我女兒一起去吧
[$Tablet]: My daughter left. Go with my daughter.
[$PlayerName]: Oh!
[$PlayerName]: [$Char5Last], your daughter hasn't left - she'll be back in a few minutes.
[$Tablet]: 你女兒沒有離開 - 她會在幾分鐘後回來。

[$Player]: I think many families feel the way you do now - transitioning a loved one into long term care is a really difficult process.
[$Player]: But we can take good care of your mom with our many services here. We have volunteers that can speak Cantonese with her. We have activities from her culture that she will enjoy. 
[$Player]: You’ve mentioned how your mom always took great care of you and your kids.  I believe that’s what you’re doing for her now, and I think she feels that ways too.
[$Susannah]: Thank you. 
[$Player]: I've got to go, take care for now. 
[$Susannah]: Bye!

[$PlayerName]:Let me walk you back to your mom's room, then I'll ask the Nurse Manager to come and discuss it with you.
<<SetPath Controller Zero>>
<<SetPath Susannah One>>//***Progerammers Note********Player and Susannah walk to Resident’s Room. Nurse Manager, Mrs. Lee, Susannah and the PLAYER 

[$PlayerName]: Oh, [$SupervisorName], you're here! I was just going to go find you. Susannah wanted to ask you about making some adjustments to [$Char5Last]'s mealplan.
[$SupervisorName]: Of course! How can I help? 
[$Susannah]:   I’m concerned about my mother's health... Brian and I are worried she’s not eating her meals. 
[$SupervisorName]: Hmm, well it’s only been a few days since she moved in - sometimes a change like that can affect a person's appetite.
[$Susannah]: Sure, but I think it also has to do with the type of food here. At home, she would have authentic Chinese meals - that’s what she’s eaten all her life.
[$SupervisorName]: Of course. Thanks for letting us know - I’ll have the dietician stop by with a meal plan survey to see what choices might best fit your mom. 
[$Susannah]: Okay, thank you!
[$SupervisorName]:  However, I should say because we have residents from many different cultural backgrounds I’m afraid we can’t accommodate everyone’s preferences.  
[$SupervisorName]: We do try to offer some alternatives and some families bring in a resident’s favourite foods from home to supplement our menus. 
[$Susannah]:  I didn’t know we could do that.  We can certainly bring her some home-cooked meals. 
[$SupervisorName]: There's one other thing - it's a new program here . The residents learn to cook different foods from their culture and they teach each other.  I think your mom would enjoy it.
[$Susannah]: 還有一件事 - 這是一個新的計劃。居民學會從他們的文化中烹飪不同的食物，他們互相教導。我想你的媽媽會喜歡它。
[$Char5Last]: 我會做飯 //happytag
[$PlayerName]: Yes! And you’ll be cooking with the other residents.  The class is every Wednesday afternoon. 
[$Susannah]: You could make new friends to share your famous dishes from China. 
[$Char5Last]: 他們不喜歡我。我不會說英語。 
[$Susannah]:  She doesn’t feel like she belongs here.  Katherine is warm and friendly but mom feels she has no one to talk to.

[$Char5Last]: 沒有。
[$SupervisorName]: Um, I think what [$PlayerName] means is that we can accomadate any communication gaps with the other residents. 
[$SupervisorName]: We can use the tablet to translate for her,or try to have a volunteer who speaks Cantonese to translate for your mom during the class.
