[$PlayerName]: Hi Ranjit! I haven't seen you in a while - how's your student placement going?
[$Student]: Ugh please -- don’t even try to talk to me! I’m in such a bad mood today…
[$PlayerName]: Hmmm... What’s wrong?
[$Sudent]: *sigh* I just came back from giving a bath to the new resident and half of it was spent trying to stop her from crying… 
[$Sudent]: It took every ounce of strength not to breakdown and cry myself. 
[$PlayerName]: You've been having a tough time?
[$Sudent]: This job is just too much… I’m so physically and emotionally exhausted all the time… 
[$Sudent]: Some days I just feel like I’m going to collapse. I don't have the energy for this anymore.
[$PlayerName]: Ranjit, it sounds like you're burnt out.
[$Sudent]: I don’t know… what does burnout feel like?
[$PlayerName]: It can happen when we get really stressed. 
[$PlayerName]: Some signs of burnout are fatigue, forgetfulness, insomnia, loss of appetite, lack of energy and focus.
[$PlayerName]: It can even increase the chance of illness.
[$Sudent]: That’s exactly how I’ve been for the past three months…
[$PlayerName]: This is a tough job and we all have to learn to manage our stress. Stress management and burnout prevention are very important. 
[$PlayerName]:Luckily, we have an employee wellness program here at [$HospitalName]. I really recommend going to the office and speaking with someone. 
[$PlayerName]We need to practice self-care, not just for ourselves, but so that we can better take care of our residents.
[$Sudent]: Thanks [$PlayerName], that's really valuable advice. I appreciate you listening and being understanding.
[$PlayerName] Of course.
