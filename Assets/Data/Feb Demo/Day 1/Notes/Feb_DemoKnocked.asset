  VariableTrue: "Today you had an awkward encounter with [$Char4Last]. This wasn\u2019t
    necessarily anyone\u2019s fault - these things can happen, and the important thing
    is how we respond when they do. It\u2019s great that you knocked and waited for
    her response - respecting the privacy of residents helps put them at ease, and
    let\u2019s them feel like this is really their home. In future, wait outside until
    a resident has clearly given consent for you to enter their room.\r\n"
  VariableFalse: "Today you entered [Char4Last]\u2019s room without knocking, and
    as a result you ended up in quite an awkward predicament. It\u2019s always important
    to knock and wait for a response before entering any resident\u2019s room. Respecting
    the privacy of residents helps put them at ease, and let\u2019s them feel like
    this is really their home.\r\n"
