  VariableTrue: "It was disappointing to hear you speaking so rudely to [$Char4Last]
    \ today. Obviously it can be frustrating when he have difficulty being understood
    or understanding others, but raising your voice certainly doesn\u2019t do anything
    to help the situation. It\u2019s your responsibility to remain calm and polite,
    and to find an appropriate way to bridge the communication gap.\r\n"
  VariableFalse: "Even though you and [$Char4Last] had a difficult time communicating,
    you did well to seek out assistance and find a way to resolve the situation. It\u2019s
    always ok to ask for help when you need it \u2013 it\u2019s great you two now
    have a tool you can use to communicate and get to know each other!\r\n"
